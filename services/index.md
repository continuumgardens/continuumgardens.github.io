* Continuum Gardens is proud to be a responsible local provider of residential and commercial landscaping services.

Professionalism
We have over 25 years of experience designing, installing, and maintaining gardens. Continuum Gardens is a fully licensed, bonded and insured General Contractor with the State of Washington [(CONTIGL923CL)][8]. We build close relationships with clients during the course of our projects and focus on clear communication and customer satisfaction.

Creativity & Craftmanship
Continuum Gardens excels at creating unique, inspired and appropriate solutions for each garden site and style. We pay attention to every detail from choosing and setting stone to selection, siting and facing of plants.

Sustainability
At Continuum Gardens sustainability starts with a thorough site assessment and carefully considered design. A sustainable garden is the sum of its parts, all of which are integral to the whole. Hardscape features and plantings are chosen according to the topography and microclimates of the site. Materials are chosen based on quality, durability and origin. If materials are available on-site, they are used. Plants are chosen and placed not only for their aesthetic qualities but also for their longevity, durability and appropriateness to site. Our goal is to create a garden that will thrive with minimal input and provide a rewarding, enduring source of enjoyment for years to come.

Environmental Stewardship & Economy
We are a five-star certified landscape company through King County's [EnviroStar][1] program. We are also longtime members and supporters of Plant Amnesty. Our mandate to protect the environment means that your garden will be a safe haven for you and your family. Careful design choices eliminate the need for toxic and costly chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides. Our commitment to organic soil preparation and careful selection of plants helps conserve water, an increasingly precious resource. These practices all contribute to a healthier environment while saving you money.

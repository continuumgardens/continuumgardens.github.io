    <p>Continuum Gardens is proud to be a responsible local provider of residential and commercial landscaping services.</p>
    <p><span class="subtitle">Professionalism</span><br />
      We have over 25 years of experience designing, installing, and
      maintaining gardens. Continuum Gardens is a fully licensed, bonded
      and insured General Contractor with the State of Washington <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/lni/bbip/Search.aspx" id="license">(CONTIGL923CL)</a>. We build close relationships with clients during the course of our projects and focus on clear communication and customer satisfaction.</p>
    <p><span class="subtitle">Creativity &amp; Craftmanship</span><br />
      Continuum Gardens excels at creating unique, inspired and appropriate solutions for each garden site and style. We pay attention to every detail from choosing and setting stone to selection, siting and facing of plants.</p>
    <p><span class="subtitle">Sustainability</span><br />
      At Continuum Gardens sustainability starts with a thorough site
      assessment and carefully considered design. A sustainable garden is
      the sum of its parts, all of which are integral to the
      whole. Hardscape features and plantings are chosen according to the
      topography and microclimates of the site. Materials are chosen based
      on quality, durability and origin. If materials are available
      on-site, they are used. Plants are chosen and placed not only for
      their aesthetic qualities but also for their longevity, durability
      and appropriateness to site. Our goal is to create a garden that will thrive with minimal input and provide a rewarding, enduring source of enjoyment for years to come.</p>

<p>The foundation for any garden begins with knowledgable site
preparation. Creative, professionally installed walls, walkways,
fences and arbors using quality materials endure the test of
time. Whether we are planting one tree or an entire garden, our crew
knows the proper methods to ensure the health and longevity of your
plantings. Plant siting and spacing are a priority. We are inspired by
the beauty of the rocks, wood, and plants we work with, and take
advantage of their unique qualities to add artful touches to your
garden.</p>
<p>Continuum Gardens installs your landscape with efficiency and an
attention to detail that makes a difference. Our team members are
skilled and well trained landscape professionals who have been with
the company for years. Our combined expertise and experience, love of
plants and pride in our work means that every step in our process is
done with meticulous attention to our craft. We minimize any
inconvenience to our clients during the process, and leave your
property tidy and clean when our work is complete.</p>

Design work is a dynamic process that involves the client every step of the way.

At our preliminary meeting we get to know each other and exchange ideas. Your wishlist and a complete site assessment help define the scope of your project. The budget is an important consideration which needs to be addressed early on in the process. We follow-up with an email recap of your goals and submit a design proposal customized to your needs. Further meetings are the forum for touching base with clients to review the basic layout of the garden, add new elements and revisit your wish list. Our final design will include a planting plan, plant lists, installation notes and specifications.

<p>We offer our clients a final walk-through of their garden after the completion of a job in order to answer any questions and discuss the specific needs of your garden. We leave written instructions documenting all your new plants and how to care for them. The hardscape and all installed systems will be functioning perfectly. We also provide you with pertinent information for your records.</p>

<p>Continuum Gardens takes great pride in our work and our installation fee includes a follow up visit after one month. We are as invested in the success of a garden as our client and encourage you to call with any questions and concerns.</p>

<p>Many installation clients take advantage of our maintenance services to ensure appropriate tending and pruning of plants and trees. The first year is the most critical time for the successful establishment and training of plants. Minimizing weed infestations early on is critical to reducing future maintenance costs. We instruct and support clients who wish to tend their own gardens as well as offering a variety of maintenance options. Even our minimum of four hours per month can make a big difference!</p>

The EPA estimates that on average each American uses over 4 lbs. of pesticides a year... Every action counts!!

There are more than 80,000 chemicals used in consumer products and manufacturing in the United States - and more than 2,000 new chemicals are introduced each year. Only about 200 have been tested for safety. The government DOES NOT REQUIRE testing or health studies for chemicals including those found in house hold cleaners, pesticides, paints and stains, skin and hair care products, and the hormones used in the meat and dairy industries.

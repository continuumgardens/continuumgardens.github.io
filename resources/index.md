Continuum Gardens believes in the importance of reusing and recycling. We enjoy the creative challenge of finding innovative ways to reuse plants and materials. We reuse plants on-site as much as possible.

We find worthy homes for unwanted plants by donating them to schools, churches, community organizations and people who otherwise could not afford them.

We salvage and reuse materials such as concrete rubble, brick, stone, reclaimed concrete, drain pipe, rebar, wood. Check out our mixed media walls under the Rock, Water, and Wood section of our portfolio.

We are committed to using high quality products, preferably recycled, that last for many years. We source products from local and sustainably-minded businesses whenever possible.

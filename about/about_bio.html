<h3>Owner Biography</h3>
<div id="copy">
<img src="images/rolande.jpg" alt="Rolande Chesebro" />
<p><span class="bold">Rolande Chesebro</span> grew up in Los Angeles
  gardening with her father who was an avid outdoorsman and environmentalist. He encouraged his six children to pursue work that they had a passion for and often said, "I don't care what you choose, be a gardener if you want, just as long as you love what you do." Rolande took his advice quite literally!</p>
<p>Gardening was always a part of her life even as she pursued a career in modern dance. Surprisingly, an MFA in dance choreography turned out to be valuable training for her career as a garden designer and horticulturalist. Both disciplines require a keen understanding of visual placement, patterns and flow.</p>
<p>After moving to Seattle in 1980, Rolande worked on the crew of Garden Keepers where she acquired on the job training for professional landscaping and organic gardening. She joined the team at City People's Garden Store where she started and ran the landscaping department for four years. Rolande founded her first design/build company in 1993 and has been successfully running her own business ever since.</p>
<p>Rolande is delighted that after 17 years in business her work continues to be stimulating, dynamic, and expansive. She is inspired to explore her passion for people, nature, and the quest for balance and harmony that lies between the two.</p>
